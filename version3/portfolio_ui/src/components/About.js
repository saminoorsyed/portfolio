        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I'm currently studying computer science at Oregon State University in pursuit of my second baccalaureate degree and expect to graduate in the Spring of 2024. At the moment the bulk of my time and coursework focuses on full stack web development. As I gain fluency as a software engineer, I hope to pursue projects in artificial intelligence, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality.</p>
        <p> Outside of the time that I spend studying at my desk, I enjoy a bit of creative writing, running, and fiddling around on my guitar.</p>
