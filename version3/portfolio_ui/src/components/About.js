        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> While I'm particularly interested in web technologies at the moment,I like to see myself in more general terms as a computer programmer. I see the myriad of technologies from web development, artificial intelligence and machine learning to robotics and the internet of things as tools to improve and innovate a world of solutions which improve the quality of life and efficiency of those people who use them. At the moment I'm studying computer science online at Oregon State University and supplementing my studies by working through <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/'>The Odin Project</a>, a full stack boot camp. In the future, I look forward to contributing to and building projects that help me to explore the many tools that programmers can use.</p>
