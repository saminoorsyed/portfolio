        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> Hi, I'm currently studying computer science at Oregon State University while also pursuing my own interests in computer programming. Since the first time I began fiddling with an Arduino board in 2013, I've viewed computers as fantastically useful tools. At the moment the bulk of my time and coursework focuses on web development (which has so far been fascinating), but I look forward to exploring the many nooks and crannies the vast array of computer technologies has to offer. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence, computer vision, augmented and virtual reality as well as the internet of things. I know it's a big list, but sometimes I can't help but feel intrigued by each topic.</p>
        <p> Outside of the time that I spend studying at my desk, I enjoy a bit of creative writing, running, and playing the occasional song on a my guitar. </p>
